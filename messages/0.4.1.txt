SublimeLinter-contrib-clang-format - v0.4.1 release notes
---------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the default behaviour for this plugin changed in v0.4.0.

By default, linting will only be enabled if a .clang-format file is present in
one of the parent directories of the file being processed. Previously, the LLVM
style preset was used if no .clang-format file could be found. To restore the
previous default behaviour, add the following field to your SublimeLinter
package settings:

    "SublimeLinter.linters.clang-format.fallback-style": "llvm"
